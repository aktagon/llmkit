# AI Stock Market Analyst

An AI-powered investment system implementing an investment strategy through a multi-agent architecture using the llmkit framework.

## Overview

This system implements a three-pillar investment approach:

1. **Global Macro Analysis** - Identifies distressed countries/sectors
2. **Fundamental Analysis** - Computer-assisted screening for undervalued stocks
3. **Technical Analysis** - Oversold entry timing optimization

The system maintains a concentrated portfolio of 10-15 high-conviction positions with 2-6 month holding periods, targeting MSCI World outperformance.

## Architecture

- **Technical Analysis Agent** - Technical indicators, chart patterns, momentum analysis
- **Portfolio Management Agent** - Position tracking, risk management, performance monitoring
- **Integration Orchestrator** - Coordinates all agents and synthesizes final recommendations

### Tools Available

Each agent has access to specialized tools:

#### Market Data Tools

- `get_market_data` - Real-time stock price and volume data
- `get_economic_indicators` - Economic indicators for macro analysis

#### Analysis Tools

- `screen_fundamentals` - Screen stocks based on fundamental criteria
